# SailorMooners
### --- THIS IS A 24 HOUR PROJECT ---

Have you ever felt that your love for Sailor Moon and your love for astronomy where two universes apart?

Worry no more friend, for we have created an SPA that joins your two favorite universes!

Welcome to SailorMonners!!!

#### Origins:

This project is the result of an intensive 3,5 month fullstack development Bootcamp from Code For All_ where during the last week, as a challenge - **"The Hackathon"**, we had to assemble teams with colleges we hadn't met before and then we were given 24h to build an app with a creative concept behind it, about a theme that was announced 30 minutes before we started - The theme was "Childhood Throwback".

Our team was attributed your favorite childhood anime/cartoon Sailor Moon and had to develop an app about it from the ground up. Our team worked greatly to bring all you see too fruition and not only developed this app, but also developed great friendships :)

#### Get to know your team:

Meet Duarte Baena, Fábio Alexandre, João Cordeiro, Miguel Rosendo and Pedro Ferreira.

We hope you like our webapp and the story behind it! We sure do!

* DISCLAIMER
* In this repository you will find the original mvp, developed in 24h in a branch called **(insert branch name)** , but you will also find a branch (**main**) in which we continued to improve the app to showcase our full potencial!
